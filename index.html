                <p> Hello and welcome to my website! My name is David and I am studying to be a web developer. <br>
                    Aside from attaining a Full-Stack Certificate to work for a tech company, I plan on making <br> 
                    my own website to chronicle my life, all the wierd things that happend to me, and general <br>
                    strangeness I observe.
                </p>

                <p> I think the most important thing in my life that has always got my through the day <br>
                    is my love of dogs. And let me tell you I <em><b>LOVE</b></em> dogs. I've had 4 dogs <br>
                    in my life.
                </p>

                <h1>MY DOGS</h1>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Ranier</li>
                    <li>Buddy</li>
                    <li>Aiko</li>
                    <li>Alma</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Although I've had dogs I've never actually had a new dog.  They were all used dogs that <br>
                     I've found on the street. Ranier was a dog that wandered into my yard when I was 5 and wouldn't <br>
                     leave when his owner came. Buddy was a dog my mom's coworker found that had been hit <br>
                     by a car. Aiko was a box dog my brother found in Okinawa when he was in the Marines. <br>
                     And Alma was a dog that my sister found in Arizona that was abandoned. <br>

                </p>

                <p>I want a new dog though! A young one preferably....Like a <b>puppy</b>
                   I've only ever had mutts, but right now here's a list of my <b>Top Three Dog Breeds</b>.
